This Project is for Test.
There are five Api in MainController to get a csv File and return normaldata, invert, flatten, sum, multiply
In the future, I want to add some feature to read data from different formats so there is an interface is called IReadDataFromFile that is just implemented to read csv data
There are another project for test that use xUnit
